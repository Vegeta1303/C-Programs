# C-Programs
These are a compilations of programs raging from the very beginning of C program to Structures, and Introduction to Nodes.
These programs have been made by me during the Labs / Lectures @ Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara, International Campus Diu.
Sadly, I do not have the questions of the Lab sessions, but these are very good programs to study and understand different concepts 
and more advanced concepts such as passing any array to a function and pointers which might have been left out in the Youtube Videos 
you might be learning from.
